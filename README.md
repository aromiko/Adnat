# Adnat (React Challenge)

Hi, I'm Miko! I'm challenged by Tanda to create Adnat Project for my examination.
I know this project is far from perfect but I will continue to enhance this even when it is done for review.

## Project Setup

Install first the libraries and dependencies:
### `yarn backend:setup`
### `yarn frontend:setup`

After installing the libraries and dependencies, run the backend server.<br />
The backend server will be deployed at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
### `yarn backend:start`

Run the application.<br />
The app will be deployed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
### `yarn frontend:start`
